## [1.0.11] - 2025-11-23

### Changed
- Converted `LivePolicy` fee model from asynchronous to synchronous implementation
- Replaced `default_http_client()` (async) with `default_sync_http_client()` (sync) in `LivePolicy`
- **`Transaction.fee()` can now be called from both synchronous and asynchronous functions without any special handling**
- Removed unused `asyncio` and `inspect` imports from `transaction.py`
- Simplified `Transaction.fee()` implementation by removing async helper methods

### Fixed
- Updated all `LivePolicy` tests to use synchronous mocks instead of `AsyncMock`
- Fixed `test_transaction_fee_with_default_rate` to use explicit fee model for deterministic testing
- Removed `asyncio.run()` calls from `LivePolicy` test suite

### Notes
- This change is transparent to users - `tx.fee()` works seamlessly in both sync and async contexts without any API changes
- You can call `tx.fee()` inside `async def` functions or regular `def` functions - it works the same way
- All existing code and documentation remain compatible with no modifications required

---
## [1.0.10] - 2025-10-30

### Changed
- Updated Script ASM output to use BRC-106 compliant format (outputs `OP_FALSE` instead of `OP_0` for better human readability)
- Converted `test_arc_ef_or_rawhex.py` from unittest.TestCase to pytest style for better async test handling

### Fixed
- Added missing test dependencies to requirements.txt: `ecdsa~=0.19.0` and `pytest-cov~=6.0.0`
- Fixed pytest configuration by adding `asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope` to eliminate deprecation warnings
- Updated test expectations in `test_scripts.py` to match BRC-106 compliant ASM output
- Resolved all pytest warnings for a clean test output (154 tests passing with zero warnings)

---
## [1.0.7.1] - 2025-07-28

### Changed
- Incremented version in `__init__.py` to 1.0.7.1.

### Security
- Updated `aiohttp` and `setuptools` dependencies to use minimum version constraints.
- Redacted private key in threshold signature example for security.

---
## [1.0.7] - 2025-07-28

### Fixed
- Implemented default broadcasters for GorillaPool mainnet and testnet.
- - Updated examples to use new broadcaster functions.

### Added
- Introduced `default_broadcaster` with configurable options for testnet and custom ARC configurations.
- Added function to set API key from constant.py for Taal mainnet and testnet (`taal_broadcaster`, `taal_testnet_broadcaster`).



## [1.0.6.1] - 2025-07-03

### Fixed
Bug Fix default_http_client and add async ARC broadcasting example 

- Replaced `default_sync_http_client` with `DefaultHttpClient` in `default_http_client`.
- Introduced a new `test_async_arc.py` example demonstrating asynchronous ARC broadcasting and transaction status checking.

## [1.0.6] - 2025-06-30

### Fixed
Remove debug print statement from MerklePath.trim() method and unnecessary import statement

### Added
add step-by-step guide for sending BSV & minting NFTs

Adds a beginner-friendly tutorial that covers:

## [1.0.3] - 2025-03-26

### Fixed
Previously, the default fee rate was hardcoded to 10 satoshis per kilobyte. This update allows users to configure the default fee rate via the TRANSACTION_FEE_RATE variable in constants.py or through the environment file.

### Added
A test for the default fee rate has also been added.

### Changed
Optimized transaction preimage calculation by refactoring the tx_preimage function to directly compute the preimage for a specified input, avoiding unnecessary computation for all inputs
Achieved a 3× performance improvement in scenarios with 250 inputs, based on benchmarking

- Dedicated BIP32 derivation functions with clearer interface
- BIP44-specific functions that build on the BIP32 foundation
- Comprehensive tests for HD wallet key derivation consistency
- Enhanced error messages for hardened key derivation attempts from xpub keys

### Fixed
- PUSHDATA opcode length parsing now uses unsigned integer reading methods (read_uint8, read_uint16_le, read_uint32_le) instead of signed integer methods to prevent incorrect chunk parsing with large data lengths
- Proper handling of edge cases in Script parsing including length 0 and incomplete length specifications
- Serialization/deserialization consistency for various PUSHDATA operations

### Changed
- Refined HD wallet key derivation interface while maintaining backward compatibility
- Improved error messages for invalid derivation attempts
- Marked legacy derivation functions as deprecated while maintaining compatibility
